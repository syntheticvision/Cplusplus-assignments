I gained a lot of knowledge regarding advanced C++ principles and related real-world applications. The Workstation and LineManager modules  conception and execution enhanced my knowledge of inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming. 
It was beneficial to handle dynamic memory allocationÂ and guarantee resource security using move semantics. 
Furthermore, I became more familiar with the Standard Library by utilizing STL algorithms rather than traditional loops, which highlighted understandable and effective code standards. This project wasn't easy and did take time and lot of thinking and googling to solve problems and bugs however it added to my knowledge and experience working with C++ language.
